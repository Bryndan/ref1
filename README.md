        <h6>26, July 1992</h6>
        
        <div style="float:left;padding-right:20px"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Cephalicpre.JPG/170px-Cephalicpre.JPG"></div>
        <div>Today I was born. It was exhausting and traumatic, but overall a rewarding experience. I have spent the past nine months transitioning my consciousness into this physical vessel through which I will experience a temporal universe one instant at a time. I am a manifestation of God, a piece of the infinite tapestry, flung at the speed of time towards my own inevitable death.</div>

        <h2 id="aa">Aptitude and Ability</h2>
        <h6>Fall of 2012</h6>
        
        <div><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Escribano.jpg/330px-Escribano.jpg" class="center"></div>
        
        <div>The world has turned and my body has grown, my mind wanders the stars. I find my feet planted firmly on a mountain island in the southern hemisphere of the only planet this body will ever live on. I am speaking foreign tongues. The brown people laugh and laugh. I have found one who can read, and he offers me the words of a wise man. We are born with <em>aptitude</em> and through our actions transform that into <em>ability.</em> This is the measure of a man.</div>
        
        <h2 id="mushrooms">Mushrooms</h2>
        <h6>December 30th, 2014</h6>
        
        <div class="column"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Psilocybe_semilanceata_6514.jpg/220px-Psilocybe_semilanceata_6514.jpg"></div>
        <div class="column" style="background:white;margin:24px 5px 30px 22px"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Psilocybn.svg/220px-Psilocybn.svg.png"></div>
        <br>
        <div>I have been in and out of insanity, and returned to the place of my birth. Life is stagnant. I consume mushrooms and see visions. The world comes at me in waves, vibrating in harmony with something deep within myself. My perspective shifts just a few degrees, and my consciousness blossoms.</div>
        
        <h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>
        <h6>Summer of 2015</h6>
        
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Pakua_with_frame.svg/375px-Pakua_with_frame.svg.png" style="background:white" class="center">
        
        <p>I have left and returned again to the place where I was born. I have found the words of a wiser man. He speaks of quality, he speaks of the Tao. Tao is that immaterial which was discovered rather than created. Quality is a Tao, a path, to wisdom and enlightenment. He speaks of the betrayals of logic and science, he speaks of the alternatives that existed before Socrates. I learn of Paideia, Metanoia, Arete. I hoist my eleven cubit bronze spear and believe that it is best to be my best.</p>
        
        <h2 id="london">London</h2>
        <h6>Fall of 2015</h6>
        
        <div style="float:left;padding-right:10px"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Sea-wolf_cover.jpg/330px-Sea-wolf_cover.jpg"></div>
        
        <div style="padding-top:72px;padding-bottom:72px">I dwell now on a boat in the Pacific, the waters I have never left. The creatures of the sea flow with me and the sun and stars smile down from above. Here I find the words of the dead man London. London writes of nihilism and exestentialism. I see the clash of the ideals of Wolf Larson and Hump with my third eye. I now decide that nothing has intrinsic value, but that as life I have the ability to assign subjective value to that with which I come in contact.</div>
        <br>
        <h2 id="truth">Truth</h2>
        <h6>Summer of 2017</h6>
        
        <p>Now I have put down the roots of family, with a wife and two dogs. I am once again in a foreign land, and deep in the practical methods of Socrates. Here I learn of truth from a peer, who describes to me the thoughts of philosophers. Correspondance, correlation, and other theories battle in my mind, and in the end I believe in the correspondance theory of truth.</p>

        <div style="padding-top:24px">The words of Duncan Trussell nourish my spirit and guide the gaze of my third eye. I am physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and socially healhty. My decaying body lives in happiness, as the world spirals into chaos around me.</div>
